Dear applicants,
 
This is a confirmation that your application is successfully received at Mid Sweden University.  This is what happens next:
 
·         Your application is reviewed by the department that gives the courses that you applied for.

·         If you don’t meet requirements for a course or have chosen a combination of courses that will cause schedule clashes, then you will hear from us shortly to select new courses. If you don’t hear anything, you can assume that your course selection is fine.

·         You will receive your Confirmation of Enrolment via email during the first week of June at the latest. Students who need to apply for visas will be prioritized.

·         After you have received your Confirmation of Enrolment you can apply for accommodation. Read about the different options and how to apply here:  www.miun.se/accommodation

·         In early June, you will receive a Welcome letter via email. The Welcome letter will include information about the Introduction days, pickup service, reminder to book accommodation, travel information etc.  A lot of this information can already be found on www.miun.se/exchangestudies

·         Introduction days begin in the morning of August 26th 2015.

·         Pickup service will be available by request only, during specific dates, in the campus cities only (Sundsvall, Östersund, or Härnösand. Not Stockholm or other cities). Detailed information about the pickup service will be presented in the Welcome letter.

 

Please feel free to contact the International Office with any questions.
 
We look forward to welcoming you to Mid Sweden University in August!
